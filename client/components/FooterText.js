	<p>Tonal languages use pitch to distinguish a word's meaning. Depending on the pitch, the same syllable could mean two totally different things! For example, in Thai, <i>ma</i> spoken in a high tone would mean <i>horse</i> and in a rising tone would mean <i>dog</i>. For people who don't speak tonal languages, these tones are hard to perceive and reproduce.</p>

	<p>In-Tone helps you perceive and reproduce a language's tones. You are given a series of vocabulary flashcards with audio of the word being spoken by a native speaker. You can then record yourself saying the word, and In-Tone will provide you with a graph comparing the target's pitch values alongside your own.</p>
