Depending on the pitch, the same syllable could mean two totally different things! For example, in Thai, <i>ma</i> spoken in a high tone would mean <i>horse</i> and in a rising tone would mean <i>dog</i>. For people who don't speak tonal languages, these tones are hard to perceive and reproduce.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </Paper>\n             <Paper style={styles.card2}>\n                <div style={styles.textArea} >\n                    <h1>How In-Tone Works</h1>\n                    <br />\n                    <p style={styles.p}>\n                    In-Tone helps you perceive and reproduce a language's tones.
